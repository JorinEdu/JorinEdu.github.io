### 用see的一般将来时造句
|**肯定句**   |**否定句**    |**疑问句**    |**反义疑问句** |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
|I will see   |I won't see   |Will I see?   |Won't I see?   |
|*I shall see |              |*Shall I see? |               |
|You will see |You won't see |Will you see? |Won't you see? |
|He will see  |He won't see  |Will he see?  |Won't he see?  |
|We will see  |We won't see  |Will we see?  |Won't we see?  |
|*We shall see|              |*Shall we see?|               |
|They will see|They won't see|Will they see?|Won't they see?|
>Note:在现代英语中，shall通常只和I、We连用，以提供意见或建议。老派的绅士们也会用I shall来代替I will用于肯定句，年轻人这样遣词就显得过时了。  
但是在诗歌中，为了韵律美，各种人称都是可以使用shall的。如：*"With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, She shall have music wherever she goes."*
