# 过去进行时（Past Continuous Tense）

## 过去进行时的功能

过去的连续描述了此前一段时间内的行动或事件。这些行动或事件始于过去，并且在发言时仍在继续。换句话说，它表达了过去未完成或不完整的行动。  
它用于：  
* 通常，用过去时态描述故事中的背景。例如：  
"The sun **was shining** and the birds **were singing** as the elephant came out of the jungle. 
The other animals **were relaxing** in the shade of the trees, but the elephant moved very quickly.
She **was looking** for her baby, and she didn't notice the hunter who **was watching** her through his binoculars.
When the shot rang out, she **was running** towards the river..."  
* 描述被另一事件或动作打断的未完成动作。例如：  
"I **was having** a beautiful dream when the alarm clock rang."
* 表达改变主意。例如：  
"I **was going** to spend the day at the beach but I've decided to get my homework done instead."  
* 与单词"*wonder*"连用，是提出要求时使用的敬语。例如：  
"I **was wondering** if you could baby-sit for me tonight."

## When, While, as
这三个词，均有“当 ... 的时候”的意思。  
* **When**和**as**既可以指某一时间点，也可以指一段时间；**While**则指一段时间。  
因此，短暂性动词只能用When和as，而不能用while。  
`When/As he woke up, it was 8 o'clock.`  
`While I was waiting for a bus, I met her.`  
* When引导的从句的谓语动作，可以在主谓语动作之前、之后或同时发生；While和as引导的从句的谓语动作，必须和主谓语动作同时发生。  
`When he finished his homework, he played the game for a while. 他在完成作业之后玩游戏`  
`When I go to the museum, the door was closed. 在我到达之前，就已经关门了`  
`While I was sleeping, the telephone rang. 我睡觉的同时，电话铃响了`  
* 当主语、从句同时发生，且从句动作为延续性动作时，三者皆可使用。  
`When/While/As she was makeing a phone call, I was writing a Email.`  
* 强调两个动作同时进行，常用“过去进行时 + while + 过去进行时”结构。  
`They were rowing boats while we were climbing the hill.`  
* 强调某个动作发生时，另一个动作正在进行，常用“一般过去时 + while + 过去进行时”结构。  
`It began to rain heavily while we were having dinner.`  
* 强调某个动作正在进行时，另一个动作突然发生，常用“过去进行时 + when + 一般过去时”结构。  
`I was walking in the street when he called me.`  
* 当主句、从句同时发生，且从句时间淡化，作“一边...一边”解时，只能用as。  
`I woke up as the sun was rising.`
