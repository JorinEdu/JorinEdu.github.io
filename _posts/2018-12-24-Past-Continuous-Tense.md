The other animals **were relaxing** in the shade of the trees, but the elephant moved very quickly.
She **was looking** for her baby, and she didn't notice the hunter who **was watching** her through his binoculars.
When the shot rang out, she **was running** towards the river..."  
* 描述被另一事件或动作打断的未完成动作。例如：  
"I **was having** a beautiful dream when the alarm clock rang."
* 表达改变主意。例如：  
"I **was going** to spend the day at the beach but I've decided to get my homework done instead."  
* 与单词"*wonder*"连用，是提出要求时使用的敬语。例如：
