We use indefinite pronouns to refer to people and things when we do not know or do not need to mention who or what we are talking about.

**1.** We use **somebody, someone** and **something** in positive sentences.
*e.g. I saw somebody/someone/something in the house.*

**2.** We use **anybody, anyone** and **anything** in negative sentences or in questions.

*e.g. I did not see anybody/anyone/anything in the house.**Did you see anybody/anyone/anything in the house?*

**3.** We use **nobody, no one** and **nothing** to refer to "not anyone" and "not anything".

*e.g. there is nobody/no one/nothing in the house.*

**4.** We use **everybody, everyone** and **everything** to refer to "all people" and "all things".
*e.g. Is everybody/everyone here today?*

*everything is ready.*

When we are offering something or when we expect the answer to be "yes", we can use **something/somebody/someone** in questions.

*e.g. Would you like something to eat?*

*Is someone there?*
