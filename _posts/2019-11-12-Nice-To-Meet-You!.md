**Finn**  
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn...  
**Alice**  
And I’m Alice. Today we’re looking at a very important part of word building – suffixes.  
**Finn**  
Suffixes. We’ll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.  
**Alice**  
There’ll be a quiz…  
**Finn**  
And we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.  
**Alice**  
So: to start off, we’re going to listen to Andrea and Steve who work in a bank. They have just interviewed two people who want to work there.  
**Finn**  
And here’s a question to think about while you listen: who did Andrea and Steve like best - the first person or the second person  
**Alice**
Who did they like best? Let’s find out.  

**INSERT**  
**Andrea**  
What do you think then Steve?  
**Steve**  
Well, the first one was very excitable: he kept laughing and speaking fast.  
**Andrea**  
Perhaps it was just nervousness, but there’s no room for that in this business.  
**Steve**  
No. Now I thought the second interviewee seemed a bit more responsible.  
**Andrea**  
Yes, she did – very important when dealing with money. And she was polite.  
**Steve**  
Politeness is essential in this job.  
**Andrea**  
Absolutely. Well, I think we both know which one is more employable.  
**Finn**  
So, that’s Steve and Andrea. And we asked you: who did they like best?  
**Alice**  
And the answer is: they definitely liked the second person best. The second one was polite and responsible. The first one was a bit too excitable.  
**Finn**  
That’s right, and excitable is a key word in the show today because it ends in a suffix.  
**Alice**  
Now in the world of vocabulary, a suffix is a group of letters that you can add to the end of a word to change its form, or meaning, or both.  
**Finn**  
For example, the word excitable has the suffix -able, spelt a-b-l-e. -able makes verbs into adjectives, and we use –able words to say that a subject can do something – is able to do something - or they behave in a particular way.  
**Alice**  
So if we take the verb excite, add the suffix -able, we can say that the first interviewee was excitable, meaning: he can get very excited.  
**Finn**  
And the second one was responsible, that’s responsible with –ible, spelt ‘i-b-l-e’. She can be trusted to do the right thing. And that’s why she was more employable, now that's -able with an a again.  
Now for another suffix. Andrea and Steve talked about two interviewees. The suffix –ee, spelt e-e, makes a noun which means ‘the person who receives an action’.  
**Alice**  
For example, if you add –ee to interview, you get the person who receives an interview, an interviewee.  

**IDENT**  

You’re listening to BBC Learning English dot com.  
**Finn**  
And we’re talking about suffixes. Our final suffix for today is –ness, spelt n-e-s-s. Adding –ness to an adjective makes a noun.  
**Alice**  
That’s right, and interviewee number one suffered from nervousness – the noun form of nervous.  
**Finn**  
But number two understood the importance of politeness – the noun form of polite. Is politeness important to you Alice?  
**Alice**  
Oh yes **Finn**  , politeness is very important to me.  
**Finn**  
I think you’re very polite. Now let’s listen to today’s suffixes and words again.  
**Alice**  
The first one was: -able with an a. a-b-l-e.  
**Finn**  
excitable, employable  
**Alice**  
-ible withan i. i-b-l-e.  
**Finn**  
responsible  
**Alice**  
-ee: e-e  
**Finn**  
interviewee  
**Alice**  
-ness: n-e-s-s  
**Finn**  
nervousness, politeness  
**Alice**  
And it’s time for a quiz. Choose the correct suffix to complete the final words in these 2 sentences. Ready?  
Number 1.The most important thing to me is my family’s… a) happy-ee b) happy-able, c) happiness.  
**Finn**  
This one is the noun form of happy, so it’s c) happiness.  
**Alice**  
Number 2. I’m learning how to do this job. I’m a a) trainee b) trainable, c) train-ness.  
**Finn**  
You are receiving training, so you’re a trainee.  
**Alice**  
Well done if you got those right.  
**Finn**  
And that brings us almost to the end of today’s programme.  
**Alice**  
But before we go, here’s today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: if you use an online dictionary, type a hyphen or a dash into the search box, and then type in any of today’s suffixes. The dictionary will give you a list of words that end with your suffix.  
**Finn**  
You know, that’s a really good tip: I think I might try that. There’s more about this at BBC learning English dot com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.

Goodbye!
