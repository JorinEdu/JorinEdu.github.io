# 现在完成时

## 现在完成时的构成

现在完成时用于表示现在和过去之间的联系。动作发生在过去，但未指定具体时间点。使用这种时态表达的意思，侧重于事件的结果，而非事件本身。  

### 现在完成时用于以下情况：
* 过去开始并持续到现在的行动或情况。  
*I **have lived** in Nanjin since 1999*(我依然住在这)  
*They **haven't lived** here for years.*  
*She **has worked** in the bank for five years.*  
*We **have had** the same car for ten years.*  
***Have you played** the piano since you were a child?*
* 一件发生在一段尚未结束的时间段内的事情。  
*She **has been** to the cinema twice this week*(这周还没结束。)  
*I **have worked** hard this week.*  
*It **has rained** a lot this year.*  
*We **haven't seen** her today.*  
* 从过去一个不确定的时间点开始算，截止到目前，一件事情已经做了很多次。  
*We **have visited** XuanWu lake several times.*  
*They **have seen** that film six times*  
*It **has happened** several times already.*  
*She **has visited** them frequently.*  
*We **have eaten** at that restaurant many times.*  
* 一件刚刚完成的事情，通常用到just。  
*I **have just finished** my homework.*  
***Have you just finished** work?*  
*I **have just eaten**.*  
*We **have just seen** her.*  
***Has he just left**? *   
* 一件过去发生的，并对现在产生了影响的事。  
*He **has read** ‘War and Peace.’* (他读过这本书增加了见识.)  
*Someone **has eaten** my soup!*(所以我现在没汤喝了)  
***Have you seen** 'Gone with the Wind'?*  
*She **has studied** Japanese, Russian, and English.* 
**Note：**  
你只有在描述一件发生的时间不重要或不特别的事情时，才能使用现在完成时。
当你需要具体的给出事件的发生时间时，请使用一般过去时。  

### 现在完成时使用ever，never，already，yet

EVER  
The adverbs ever and never express the idea of an unidentified time before now(Have you ever visited Berlin?)'Ever' and 'never' are always placed before the main verb (past participle). Ever is used:  

IN QUESTIONS  
EXAMPLES  
Have you ever been to England?  
Has she ever met the Prime Minister?  

IN NEGATIVE QUESTIONS  
EXAMPLES  
Haven't they ever been to Europe?  
Haven't you ever eaten Chinese food?  

IN NEGATIVE STATEMENTS USING THE PATTERN NOTHING+EVER OR NOBODY+EVER  
EXAMPLES  
Nobody has ever said that to me before.  
Nothing like this has ever happened to us.  

WITH 'THE FIRST TIME'  
EXAMPLES  
It's the first time that I've ever eaten snails.  
This is the first time I've ever been to England.  

NEVER  
Never means at no time before now, and is the same as not ..... ever: (I have never visited Berlin)  

BE CAREFUL!You must not use never and not together  
I haven't never been to Italy.  
I have never been to Italy.  

ALREADY  
Already refers to an action that has happened at an unspecified time before now. It suggests that there is no need for repetition.  

EXAMPLES  
I've already drunk three coffees this morning. (= and you're offering me another one!)  
Don't write to John, I've already done it.  

 

It is also used in questions:  

Have you already written to John?  
Has she finished her homework already?  
 

Already can be placed before the main verb (past participle) or at the end of the sentence:  

I have already been to Tokyo.  
I have been to Tokyo already.  
 

YET  
Yet is used in negative statements and questions, to mean (not) in the period of time between before now and now, (not) up to and including the present. Yet is usually placed at the end of the sentence.  

EXAMPLES  
Have you met Judy yet?  
I haven't visited the Tate Gallery yet  
Has he arrived yet?  
They haven't eaten yet    

### 现在完成时使用for和since  

Using the present perfect, we can define a period of time before now by considering its duration, with for + a period of time, or by considering its starting point, with since + a point in time. FOR and SINCE can also both be used with the past perfect. SINCE can only be used with perfect tenses. FOR can also be used with the simple past.

FOR + A PERIOD OF TIME  
for six years, for a week, for a month, for hours, for two hours  
I have worked here for five years.  

SINCE + A POINT IN TIME  
since this morning, since last week, since yesterday  
since I was a child, since Wednesday, since 2 o'clock  
I have worked here since 1990.  

PRESENT PERFECT WITH FOR  
She has lived here for twenty years.  
We have taught at this school for a long time.  
Alice has been married forthree months.  
They have been at the hotel for a week.  

PRESENT PERFECT WITH SINCE  
She has lived here since 1980.  
We have taught at this school since 1965.  
Alice has been married since March 2nd.  
They have been at the hotel since last Tuesday.
