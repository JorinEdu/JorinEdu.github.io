We can use to-infinitives to express purpose.

*e.g. I often go to the market to watch the birds*

Now the Chinese government has made laws to prevent all these things.

We can also use **in order to** to express purpose. This is more formal than using **to-infinitives**.

*e.g. Some people want to make the wetlands smaller **in order to** have more space for farms and buildings.*

*Take a notebook with you in order to write down what you see.*
